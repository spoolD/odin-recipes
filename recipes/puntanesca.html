    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of our personal favorite 
            vegetarian recipes. Feel free to substitute
            spaghetti for the squash. Recipe originally taken
            from <a href="https://www.feastingathome.com/roasted-spaghetti-squash-with-eggplant-puttanesca/">here</a>
             . We also omit the caper and olives.

        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lb spaghetti squash (or sub pasta noodles)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium eggplant cut into a small dice</li>
            <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
            <li>4-6 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>14 oz can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried italian herbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
            <li>splash red wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olives</li>
            <li>Possible garnish: fresh parsley, grated parmesan, or olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>425F</strong></li>
            <li>Cut squash in half <em>widthwise</em>, place open side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet in the oven and roast for <strong>30-40 minutes</strong> (depending on size) or until knife tender. Turn on their sides, allowing steam to escape, continue roasting <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>, so they dry out a bit.</li>
            <li>While the squash is roasting make the Eggplant Puttanesca sauce.</li>
            <li>In a large heavy bottom skillet or dutch oven, heat 3 tablespoons oil over med-high heat. Add diced onion and eggplant, and saute, stirring often for <strong>4-5 minutes</strong>. Add garlic and red bell pepper, turn heat down to medium and continue cooking until eggplant is tender, about <strong>10-12 more minutes</strong>, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, a generous splash of wine, chili flakes, salt, pepper, Italian herbs, and simmer on low heat <strong>5-10 more minutes</strong>. Add capers and olives.</li>
            <li>Taste, adjust salt, spice level and add more capers or olives to taste. Sometimes Iâ€™ll add a little splash of the caper or olive brine, to bump up the flavor.</li>
            <li>When spaghetti squash is tender, scoop the seeds out- then scoop out spaghetti squash strands into a bowl, and fluff and toss well with salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Divide among bowls and top with the eggplant puttanesca. Sprinkle with fresh Italian parsley and grated cheese (optional)  or drizzle olive oil.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can serve this right out of the spaghetti squash shell, making sure to season the squash, mixing with a fork before topping with the putttanesca.</li>
        </ol>
